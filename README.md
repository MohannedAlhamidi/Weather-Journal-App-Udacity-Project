# Weather-Journal-App-Udacity-Project
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This project makes use of web APIs to load the data dynamically and update the UI. It makes fetch requests from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve current weather based on a given zip code value. It also saves the temperature along with other information to a local server which is set up with Node.js and Express.This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
